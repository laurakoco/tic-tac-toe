# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

A Tic-Tac-Toe GUI application with an AI opponent.

## Background

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player, turn-based game. The actions and win conditions are straightforward and simple to understand. The number of actions in each state is limited, and the state of the game is easily represented.

Two players (each represented by *X* and *O*) take turns marking the spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game [1].

The possible outcome for a player is a win, loss or draw. A win for one player implies a loss for the other; for this reason, Tic-Tac-Toe is a **zero-sum game**.

Each player's goal state is a win. As such, the player's goals are competing, which leads to an **adversarial search** problem.

## Motivation

This project implements different AI search algorithms:
* Optimal decisions
	* Minimax
	* Alpha-beta pruning
* Imperfect real-time decisions
	* Alpha-beta with cutoff (heuristic evaluation)
    
    The minimax algorithm generates the entire game search space and yields a perfect decision for the AI. Thus, the AI using minimax is unbeatable. The alpha-beta prunes prunes away large and unecessary parts of the minimax game tree, so it too yeilds an optimal decision. Both minimax and alpha-beta pruning require searching all the way to the terminal states (for at least one portion of the tree).
    
    Because the tic-tac-toe solution space is relatively small (9! = 362,880), it is possible to employ an optimal decision. For more complicated games searching the whole tree is not possible. An evaluation function can be implemented to approximate the best decision for the AI.
    
 This project highlights the tradeoffs in time complexity and space complexity between optimal and imperfect AI search algorithms.
 
## Built With

* Python 2.7
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

## Usage

```python
python run_tic_tac_toe.py
```

This will launch a pygame window.

The terminal will prompt the choice of AI:

1. Random
2. Minimax
3. Alpha-beta
4. Alpha-beta with cutoff
